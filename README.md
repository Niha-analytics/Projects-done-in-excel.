# Projects-done-in-excel.
This Repository contains projects that I completed in excel.

1) [Visualizing and summarizing customer data for a bank using Excel](https://github.com/Niha-analytics/Projects-done-in-excel./tree/main/Visualizing%20and%20summarizing%20customer%20data%20for%20a%20bank%20using%20Excel)

The marketing team of the Bank wants to better visualize & summarize its data to help them in understanding its customers better. This exercise would enable them to target the right customers to help improve their success rate (#customers availing loans/#customers targeted) & reduce their marketing costs.
   In this project i have made use of various function of excel like pivot table, groupby, data slicing etc.
