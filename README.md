# Projects-done-in-excel.
This Repository contains projects that I completed in excel.

1) [Visualizing and summarizing customer data for a bank using Excel](https://github.com/Niha-analytics/Projects-done-in-excel./tree/main/Visualizing%20and%20summarizing%20customer%20data%20for%20a%20bank%20using%20Excel)

The marketing team of the Bank wants to better visualize & summarize its data to help them in understanding its customers better. This exercise would enable them to target the right customers to help improve their success rate (#customers availing loans/#customers targeted) & reduce their marketing costs.
   In this project i have made use of various function of excel like pivot table, groupby, data slicing etc.

2) [Probability of having a heart attack](https://github.com/Niha-analytics/Projects-on-data-analysis-done-in-excel./tree/main/Probability%20of%20having%20a%20heart%20attack_Naive%20bayes)

There are several different types and forms of heart disease. The most common ones cause narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, malfunctioning in the valves of the heart, enlargement in the size of the heart, and several others leading to heart failure and heart attack.
In this problem, we are going to predict the chance of having a heart attack given the
factors associated with it.
Here, I have build a basic classifier based on the Bayes
theorem to predict the chances of a person suffering a heart attack.
